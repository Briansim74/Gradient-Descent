# Gradient-Descent
Introduction to gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.
<br/>In this lab we will explore the gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithms for solving a least squares optimization problem.
<br/>Within this repository you will find the Python file for the lab and the sample data file.
